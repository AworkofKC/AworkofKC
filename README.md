# 👋 Hi, I’m @AworkofKC

❤️ A creative thinker with a background in administrative and customer-focused work, now channeling that energy and problem-solving into the field of **cybersecurity**. My focus is on **Blue Team tactics, threat detection, and protecting sensitive data** with clarity and intention.

🛠️ **Completed the Google Cybersecurity Certificate** and **earned the CompTIA Security+ certification.**  
I’m now building practical tools and projects that turn cybersecurity concepts into real-world solutions—like automated alert systems and smarter methods for managing security data.

📚 Strengthening hands-on skills in **Python, SQL, Linux, and SIEM technologies**, while exploring new ways to simplify complex processes and make cybersecurity more efficient and accessible.

✨ Beyond tech, I enjoy creating, learning, exploring, and crafting ideas that combine creativity with purpose. I find meaning in simplifying the complicated and making information feel clear and actionable.
