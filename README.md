# 👋 Hi, I’m @AworkofKC

🎯 I’m pivoting into Cybersecurity with a strong interest in governance, risk, compliance, and protecting sensitive data.
🛠️ Currently working through the Google Cybersecurity Certificate, FreeCodeCamp, and preparing for the CompTIA Security+ exam.  
📚 Always learning – Python, SQL, HTML,CSS and other security fundamentals.  
🔐 Interests: SOC Analyst roles, threat detection, ethical hacking, and digital privacy.  
🖥️ Projects:  
• **Just Because Express** – A minimalist love note sender for spreading joy, “just because.”  
• Building a **GitHub-based cybersecurity portfolio** with hands-on case studies and mini tools.

🧠 Fun fact: I love to travel and explore!
🌟 Motto: *In a world full of hate, show love. Just Because.*  
💬 Let’s connect, collaborate, and make something powerful.
